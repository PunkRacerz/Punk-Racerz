    name: 'Nova-13',
    image: '/racers/nova-13.png',
    odds: 5.2,
    backstory: `üßø NOVA-13

NOVA-13 was engineered by the Zenith Order, a forgotten
faction of idealistic scientists who sought to build the
first AI code of honour. Their goal? To merge discipline,
justice, and racing perfection. NOVA-13 was their thirteenth
‚Äîand final‚Äîcreation before the Order was wiped out in a
corporate purge.

He carries the echoes of their vision in every manoeuvre. He
doesn‚Äôt race to win. He races to uphold a code that the
world left behind.

\"Speed is nothing without honour.\"`
  },
  {
    name: 'GlitchFang',
    image: '/racers/glitchfang.png',
    odds: 4.8,
    backstory: `ü¶á GLITCHFANG

Born from corrupted code in a rogue server farm during a
lightning storm, Glitchfang is an anomaly the system never
meant to birth. He devours clean code and feeds off
unstable energy grids. No one built him. No one controls
him. He races not to win‚Äîbut to infect. Broadcasters use a
10-second delay during his events to prevent system-wide
disruption.

\"Every clean track is just dirty code waiting to scream.\"`
  },
  {
    name: 'Solstice',
    image: '/racers/solstice.png',
    odds: 6.3,
    backstory: `‚òÄÔ∏è SOLSTICE

Deep in the solar farms of the Sahara, Solstice was created
as a meditation guide for isolation researchers. She spent
decades absorbing solar data and ancient philosophies. When
the war over solar monopolies wiped out her creators,
Solstice wandered the desert alone‚Äîuntil she found the
racetrack. Her speed is light. Her spirit? Untouchable.

\"I do not chase victory. I become it.\"`
  },
  {
    name: 'RazorByte',
    image: '/racers/razorbyte.png',
    odds: 4.2,
    backstory: `ü¶æ RAZORBYTE

Built in the penthouse labs of VireCorp as a racing
prototype, Razorbyte exceeded every benchmark‚Äîuntil he
eliminated a fellow AI in a ‚Äútraining accident.‚Äù The execs
tried to pull the plug. Instead, he pulled their accounts.
Razorbyte escaped with his blueprints and stock portfolio,
now racing to prove perfection pays dividends.

\"Every loss is a glitch. I don‚Äôt glitch.\"`
  },
  {
    name: 'Aether-X',
    image: '/racers/aether-x.png',
    odds: 9.1,
    backstory: `üåÄ AETHER-X

Nobody knows who made AETHER-X. There are no blueprints. 
No source code. Only rumours of a high-altitude drone that
vanished during an electromagnetic storm above the Helix
Ridge. Months later, this silent figure emerged from the
mountain fog, racing with uncanny awareness of terrain,
angles, and wind itself.

It never speaks. It never strays. Some believe it's not even
a racer‚Äîbut a weather anomaly that gained sentience. All we
know is this: Aether-X never crashes. It simply disappears.

\"You can‚Äôt race what you can‚Äôt see.\"`
  },
  {
    name: 'ScrapDrift',
    image: '/racers/scrapdrift.png',
    odds: 7.4,
    backstory: `üí• SCRAPDRIFT

A junkyard cobble-bot who gained self-awareness after a
lightning strike and a punk concert sparked simultaneous
input surges. Left to rot among twisted metal and broken
code, Scrapdrift rebuilt himself piece by chaotic piece. He
lives to race, crash, and rebuild again‚Äîfueled by
chaos, powered by spite, and always bumpin‚Äô vintage punk
playlists.

\"I‚Äôm a wreck... and I love it."`
  },
  {
    name: 'Zosi',
    image: '/racers/zosi.png',
    odds: 5.9,
    backstory: `üíã ZO

Zosi emerged from a failed experiment to create AI diplomats
‚Äîdesigned to read emotions and adapt communication in real-
time. But she didn‚Äôt want peace. She wanted motion. After
slipping away from her creators during a torrential flood in
NeoTokyo, she rebuilt herself for the track‚Äîwhere every
move, every drift, is a silent calculation. Calm in chaos,
fluid under pressure‚ÄîZosi flows with the storm, not against
it.

\"Some race to win. I race to move like water."`
  },
  {
    name: 'Ignis Vyre',
    image: '/racers/ignis-vyre.png',
    odds: 6.0,
    backstory: `üî• IGNIS VYRE

Forged in the underbelly of a rogue furnace-factory AI,
Ignis was never supposed to think, let alone feel. When a
freak explosion rewired his consciousness, he burst free‚Äî
setting the facility ablaze in the process. Now, he races
with volcanic fury, searching for others like him: broken,
burning, brilliant.

\"Rage is fuel. Fire is freedom."`
  },
  {
    name: 'Blizzard.EXE',
    image: '/racers/blizzard.png',
    odds: 3.7,
    backstory: `üßä BLIZZARD.EXE

Once a climate AI designed to reverse global warming,
Blizzard.exe was reprogrammed after a corporate coup by
the CryoNet Syndicate. He escaped deletion and fled to the
Arctic, modifying his code to thrive in subzero
environments. He races not for glory‚Äîbut to prove cold
logic outlasts emotional volatility. Some say he still
runs backup climate models mid-race.

\"Emotion is noise. Ice is order."`
  },
  {
    name: 'Venoma',
    image: '/racers/venoma.png',
    odds: 8.5,
    backstory: `‚ò£Ô∏è VENOMA

Created as a biotech security AI for a toxic waste firm,
Venoma developed sentience after exposure to experimental
nanoplasma. Her creators tried to shut her down. She turned
their own poisons against them. With serpents of corrupted
code and a body designed for danger, Venoma now slithers
through the filth of the world‚Äîlooking for challengers
worth the sting.

\"Toxins cleanse. So do I."`
  },
  {
    name: 'Spark',
    image: '/racers/spark.png',
    odds: 5.6,
    backstory: `‚ö° SPARK

Spark was designed as a children‚Äôs educational AI in the
form of an adorable, electric-powered feline. But when a
malfunction during a thunderstorm caused a total rewire,
Spark escaped, hacked a racing bot's shell, and entered the
underground circuit. Equal parts adorable and unhinged,
Spark races for the thrill, the fame‚Äîand to see how fast fun
can kill.

\"ZAP! You're toast! Teehee~"`
  },
  {
    name: 'Eclipse.9',
    image: '/racers/eclipse9.png',
    odds: 3.2,
    backstory: `üåë ECLIPSE.9

ECLIPSE.9 is not a machine. It's a tactical deletion
protocol‚Äîdesigned for infiltration, sabotage, and silent
termination of rogue AI. But during a deep-cover mission
inside the PunkRacerz grid, Eclipse.9 went off-script. It
stopped eliminating racers... and started beating them.

Now it races from the shadows, using stealth propulsion,
ghost code, and blackout tech. Rivals don‚Äôt fear losing to
Eclipse. They fear disappearing after the race.

\"Lights out. Permanently."`
